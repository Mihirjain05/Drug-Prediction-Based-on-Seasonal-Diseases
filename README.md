# Drug-Prediction-Based-on-Seasonal-Diseases

Drug prediction based on seasonal diseases and optimizing medical inventory is an important project in the field of healthcare and medicine. With the changing seasons, the incidence and prevalence of certain diseases can vary, and it is crucial to have accurate predictive models that can help healthcare providers anticipate and prepare for these changes. Additionally, optimizing medical inventory can help healthcare organizations minimize shortages and wastage of drugs, while ensuring adequate stock during peak demand periods. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict the demand for specific drugs based on the seasonal patterns of different diseases. By analyzing historical data on disease incidence and drug sales, we will build a model that can provide accurate predictions and assist healthcare providers in managing their inventory effectively. This project is important as it can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of medical inventory management, ultimately benefiting patient care.
